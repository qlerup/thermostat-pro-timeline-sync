# Thermostat Pro Timeline Sync

Use together with **Thermostat Pro Timeline Card** ([Link](https://github.com/qlerup/lovelace-thermostat-pro-timeline)).  
This integration **synchronizes the Thermostat Timeline** across users and devices in Home Assistant, so everyone sees and uses the same schedule.
